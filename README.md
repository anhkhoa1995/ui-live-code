# Smitegate-LiveCodeUI

- Mini project Vue3 with SCSS.
- Don’t use any UI CSS framework/library
- Create a simple layout with a header and content
- The header includes a logo, title, and 3 menu items on the right, docked on the top
- The content is a list of cards with images and text, there are gaps between the cards
- The image‘s ratio is always 3/2 regardless of the image’s size
- If the text is too long, it should be truncated
- When resizing the browser, the number of cards on a line will change, changing font size in browser settings should trigger the change in the number of cards
- Try to make the UI consistent on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, ...)
